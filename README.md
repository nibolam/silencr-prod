Chrome extension that automatically mutes ads during live streaming TV.

Currently supports basketball and baseball streams.

## Installation

Until the extension is published to the Chrome web store, the easiest way to install it is by loading it as an unpacked extension in developer mode.

1. Download dist.zip from the most recent release and extract it
2. Go to the chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions)
3. In the upper right, toggle Developer Mode to the ON position
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the upper left and select the extracted dist folder from step 1

## Use

- On a supported streaming site, enable the extension by clicking on the extension icon then checking the box shown in the popup. Pressing Alt+M will also enable the extension. 
- To stop mute updates, uncheck the box in the pop or press Alt+M.
