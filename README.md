# silencr

Chrome extension that automatically mutes ads during live streaming TV.

Currently supports basketball and baseball streams.

## Installation

Until the extension is published to the Chrome web store, the easiest way to install it is by loading it as an unpacked extension in developer mode.

1. Download dist.zip from the most recent release and extract it
2. Go to the chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions)
3. In the upper right, toggle Developer Mode to the ON position
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the upper left and select the extracted dist folder from step 1

## Use

- Silencr will automatically run in the background on supported streaming live TV sites.
- To stop mute updates for the current session use the keyboard shortcut Alt+M. Hitting Alt+M again will resume mute updates.
